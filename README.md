# Retinal Vessel Segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks

This is actually one of the programming assignment of COMP2211 (Exploring Artificial Intelligence) in HKUST. This jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use CNN to do retinal vessel segmentation.

You can see the source code in pa2.ipynb.

The official solution to the source code is in pa2_sol.ipynb.

---

## How to run?

1. Upload pa2.ipynb and all other .npz files to Google Colab. 
2. Change the runtime to T4 GPU as we need to use GPU to train the model.
3. Run all the codes once.
